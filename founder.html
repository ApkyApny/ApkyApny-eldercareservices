      <h2>Our Story – A Mission From the Heart</h2>
      <p>During the pandemic, I lost my father — a loss that forever changed me.</p>
      <p>In the months that followed, I saw not only my own grief but also the quiet suffering of many elders around me — neighbors, distant relatives, even strangers — living alone, overlooked, or uncared for during lockdowns.</p>
      <p>COVID made us realize how isolation can silently break a person — especially the elderly, who need not just food or medicine, but presence, dignity, and emotional support.</p>
      <p>All this provoked me to start a venture <strong>“APKY APNY”</strong> to serve those who raised us — parents, grandparents, elders who may now be living alone while their children work long hours, live abroad, or travel.</p>
      <p>I also witnessed how hard it is for working professionals or frequent travelers to ensure their loved ones are cared for during their absence. Whether it’s groceries, medical help, or just companionship — many are silently enduring.</p>
      <p>My dream is simple: <strong>No elder should feel alone, unseen, or unsupported.</strong></p>
      <p>I couldn’t save my own father, but through <strong>“APKY APNY”</strong>, I hope to serve your loved ones like they’re my own.</p>
      <h3>Heart to Heart. Hand in Hand ♡</h3>
